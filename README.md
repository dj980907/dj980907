Hi! I am Dongjoo Lee.
You can call me DJ or Dongjoo, whichever is easier for you... ðŸ‘€
I am currently a student in New York University, majoring in computer science and economics seeking to better understand coding and software development.
My expertise includes Python, Java and R studio. 
I completed introduction to computer science, data structures, and discrete math and looking to take basic algorithms and computer systems organization.
Currently, I am seeking to find projects to collaborate with that will allow me to learn how to develop computer programs and be more familiar with coding. 
Email me at dj980907@gmail.com if you want to talk about projects!
